## Semantic Entailment
$P \models Q$ means that $P \rightarrow Q$ is `always true`

So, to check if $P$ `"semantically entails"` $Q$, check to see fi $P \rightarrow Q$ is true

A good way of thinking of semantic entailment is that if one thing semantically entails another, `any case in which the premises are true should also cause the conclusion to be true`
