## Claim: $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational
`Proof:` Suppose $\sqrt{2} $ element of $Q$. Then $\sqrt{2} = p/q$ by some $p, q$ element $Z$ such that $p$ and $q$ have no common factors other than 1.

$q \sqrt{2} = p$

$ 2q^2 = p^2$

So $p^2$ is even so p is even

$\therefore$ $$p = 2k for some $k$ element $Z$ so $p^2 = 4k^2$

$\therefore$ $2q^2 = 4k^2$

$\therefore$ $q^2 = 2k^2$

So $q^2$ is even so $q$ is also even

Since $p$ and $q$ both have 2 as a factor this is a contradiction

## Knight and Knave Shit

At least 1 knight and at least 1 knave. There may be `spys` who is neither

* `A:` B is a knave if and only if C is a knave
* `B:` If A is a knave, then C is a knave
* `C:` A is a knave or B is a knight

Suppose C is lying:

$\therefore$ A is not a knave

$\therefore$ B is not a knight

$\therefore$ C is either a knave or a spy

Hence potentially:

`A:` Knight, spy

`B:` Knave, spy

`C:` Knave, spy

$\therefore$ by elimination, A is a knight

Suppose B is a knave:

> What two things do we find out

A is a knave and C is a not a knave

This is a `contradiction` because we `require at least 1 knave`

B is not a knave

C is not a knave

`Contradiction!`

C is telling the truth hence is either a `knight or a spy`

Suppose B is lying:

$\therefore$ A is a knave, C is not a knave and B is a knave

Hence, C is a knight by elimination

Suppose A is telling the truth

$\therefore$ A is not a knave

$\therefore$ B is a knight
