# Web App - Generating Parsons Problems for Data Analytics
## What are Parsons Problems

_Parsons problems are composed of **randomised blocks of code** that require learners to **match an expected output** or achieve a goal_ (Parsons and Haden, 2006)

* **Designed for beginners** or people just getting started
* Like a puzzle
* Drag and drop
* Created by hand (educators)
* Problems are usually created for **fundamental programming constructs**

## The Project

Create a web app that allows users to generate a Parsons problem for Data Analytics, based on their selected topic and context

* A Parsons problem about linear regression with a context about koalas.
  * Topic: **Linear Regression**
  * Context: **Koalas**
## Requirements (Vague)
* Easy to use interface
* Problems generated **using ChatGPT**
* Problems are **customised based on topic and context selected by the user**
* Users should recieve **feedback** each time they submit
  * Feedback recieved is similar to result given if you run code in any IDE
    * Error messages, suggestions etc
* Analytics stored on users' interactions with the web app and the problems
